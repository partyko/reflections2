**** When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    One may want to use a remote repository when one is away from his local computer.

**** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    One may want to always pull changes manually (rather tha having Git do it automatically), since there could be the possibility of serious conflicts of changes made in the remote and in local repositories.

**** Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of a GitHub repository done by GitHub site itself.  Unlike regular clone on a local machine, each repository fork points to its source fork.

    Clones are copies of a repositories in the local machine. The clone source could either be GitHub repository or another local repository.  Unlike a GitHub fork, a clone does not have a way of referencing its source repository.

    Branches are copies of a master repository. A branch is is usually taken from the tip node of the master branch. But it could also be made from any commits earlier than that of the tip node. A branch can be made on a repository on a local machine; it could also be made on a GitHub repository.
