**** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	An initial git repository -- .git folder, is created when the command "git init" is executed. The presence of the git repository is needed for recording all the commits in the working directory.

**** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area contains the file or (logically-related) files that are ready to be committed (for tracking) to the git repository.  The working directory contains all the files -- those about to be committed and those that are not yet  ready for committing to the repository of the project.
