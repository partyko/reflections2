**** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	An initial git repository -- .git folder, is created when the command "git init" is executed. The presence of the git repository is needed for recording all the commits in the working directory.

**** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area contains the file or (logically-related) files that are ready to be committed (for tracking) to the git repository.  The working directory contains all the files -- those about to be committed and those that are not yet  ready for committing to the repository of the project.

**** How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Use the staging area for staging files that are inter-related with respect to the single feature that has been added or single bug that has been fixed.

**** What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches based on the master branch (production quality, always works, never breaks) would be helpful when making experimental changes or when exploring solutions without touching any of the content of the actual master branch.

	Branching may be seen as a sort of a path for "context-switching" on the project.
